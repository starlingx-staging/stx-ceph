.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBceph\-disk\fP is a utility that can prepare and activate a disk, partition or
directory as a Ceph OSD. It is run directly or triggered by \fBceph\-deploy\fP
or \fBudev\fP\&. It can also be triggered by other deployment utilities like \fBChef\fP,
\fBJuju\fP, \fBPuppet\fP etc.
.sp
It actually automates the multiple steps involved in manual creation and start
of an OSD into two steps of preparing and activating the OSD by using the
subcommands \fBprepare\fP and \fBactivate\fP\&.
.sp
\fBceph\-disk\fP also automates the multiple steps involved to manually stop
and destroy an OSD into two steps of deactivating and destroying the OSD by using
the subcommands \fBdeactivate\fP and \fBdestroy\fP\&.
.sp
The documentation for each subcommand (prepare, activate, etc.) can be displayed
with its \fB\-\-help\fP option. For instance \fBceph\-disk prepare \-\-help\fP\&.
.SH AVAILABILITY
.sp
\fBceph\-disk\fP is part of Ceph, a massively scalable, open\-source, distributed storage system. Please refer to
the Ceph documentation at \fI\%http://ceph.com/docs\fP for more information.
